<p>The tiger population in Nepal&nbsp;<a href="https://news.mongabay.com/2022/07/nepal-was-supposed-to-double-its-tiger-population-since-2010-it-tripled-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nearly tripled</a>&nbsp;over the past 12 years. As part of global efforts to double the wild tiger population, the country’s target was to have 250 tigers by this year, but the figure of 355 surpassed that.</p>

<p>Despite the applause, various concerns have emerged, especially about the maximum number of tigers that can live in the country, and the escalation of human-tiger conflict.

<p>No agency is more central to both the successes and shortcomings of Nepal’s tiger policy than the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation, the country’s primary and frontline body when it comes to advising the government on conservation and implementing its policies and programs.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The department, whose officers such as wardens and game scouts work in various protected areas of the country alongside the army, has been credited for the success of Nepal’s tiger conservation program. However, it has also been criticised at times for its inability to address the concerns of Indigenous peoples and local communities living close to protected areas.</p>

<p><strong>Maheshwar Dhakal:&nbsp;</strong>Tiger conservation now needs to be aligned with various multilateral agreements such as the Ramsar Convention, the UNFCCC (U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change), UNCBD (U.N. Convention on Biological Diversity) and even Sustainable Development Goals. We can’t just focus on tigers as umbrella species and hope that everything else will fall in place once the tiger numbers increase.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The other aspect is that we need to develop key biological corridors for tigers to move north to the Chure foothills where they can get water and cool off during summer and then return south to the [Terai] grasslands. Also, the banks of rivers originating from the Chure need to be revitalised by planting appropriate trees so that tigers can move freely. We have observed some signs of tigers in almost all districts of the Terai in Nepal, including densely populated areas.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the context of international corridors such as the Khata corridor, which connects Nepal with India, we also need to develop it as an economic corridor through sustainable practices such as agroforestry.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s not fair that the conservation department, which worked so hard to get the tiger numbers up, should be looked upon to promote tourism or other activities to lift up the economic standards of the people. Now that the tiger numbers are up, other agencies such as the Ministry of Tourism and the National Planning Commission need to come up with plans to encourage the private sector to come up with plans and projects to bring in tourists to see the tigers and spend money in the local economy.</p>
