<p><a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/author/roshni-chakrabarty"><strong>By Roshni Chakrabarty</strong></a>: The IITs are now not just an epitome of academic and innovative success in India but also recognised across the world in other countries – so signified Union Education and Skill Development Minister Dharmendra Pradhan in his speech as the chief guest at IInventiv.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<h3><strong>IITS AS ‘RATNABHANDARS’</strong></h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Speaking about the magnitude of the innovative projects that can be found at the various IITs in India, Dharmendra Pradhan called them ‘ratnabhandars’ or treasure chests.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He said that an IIT visit could hardly be completed in a day because the IITs were full of old wisdom and experience which can prove to be bridges to a bright future. There was simply too much to see and experience.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He hoped that IInvenTiv would become an event of global note in the coming years when people from all over the world would come to India to attend the same for the innovative ideas and projects being showcased that could solve problems in their own nations as well.</p>

<p>“When representatives of other nations -- both developing and developed nations -- approach me to talk about establishing IITs in their countries at their own expenses, I feel proud that the skill magnitude in the IITs and the experimentation India is doing with the IITs is being recognised,” said the union education minister.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He said that India has achieved a leadership position in certain key areas such as software development, finance management, affordable healthcare and legal advice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He said that PM Narendra Modi had called for the development of research-based entrepreneurship.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>“The emerging market capacity of India can take the country to unimagined heights. The sooner IIT leaders understand this factor, the sooner India can become a ‘vishwaguru’,” Pradhan said.</p>
